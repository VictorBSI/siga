Siga - Administrative Management System
=======================================

The Siga is composed of several modules:

- Siga-Doc: Document Management
- Siga-WF: Workflow
- Siga-GI: Identity Management
- Siga-GC: Knowledge Management
- Siga-SR: Services and Tickets
- Siga-tp: Trnasportation Request

The most popular module, the Siga-Doc, is able to control the processing of digital or physical documents, administrative processes or expedients, using digital certificate signature or simply signing with login and password. This module was developed following the requirements of e-Arq, so it has a high degree of adherence.
